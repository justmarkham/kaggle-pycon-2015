# Kaggle's PyCon 2015 competition

At [PyCon 2015](https://us.pycon.org/2015/), Kaggle hosted a small competition during their tutorial: [Winning Machine Learning Competitions with scikit-learn](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/321/). There were 28 teams, and we had less than three hours to work on the problem. This repo contains the [code](kaggle.py) from my first place submission.

Feel free to [contact me](http://www.dataschool.io/about/) with any questions! If you'd like to learn how to use scikit-learn for machine learning, I have a new [series of video tutorials](http://blog.kaggle.com/author/kevin-markham/) covering that topic that are hosted on Kaggle's blog.
